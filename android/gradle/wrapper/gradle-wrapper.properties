# This file is used to configure the Gradle wrapper, which is a script that allows you to run Gradle tasks
# without requiring a local Gradle installation. The wrapper downloads the specified version of Gradle
# and uses it to execute the build scripts. The properties defined here include the distribution URL,
# network timeout settings, and the base and path for storing the Gradle distribution.
# The `distributionUrl` property specifies the URL from which the Gradle distribution will be downloaded.
